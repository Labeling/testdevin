Analysis for Adding Specific Test Cases to Prompt

1. Current System Capabilities Section:
```
#System Capabilities#
- You can run automation test cases
- You CANNOT write automation test cases
- Your responses must be based on these capabilities
```

Required Changes:
- Replace generic capability with specific test list
- Maintain clear distinction between can/cannot capabilities
- Ensure specificity helps prevent incorrect responses

2. Proposed System Capabilities Update:
```
#System Capabilities#
- You can ONLY run these specific automation test cases:
  * XPay Create password
  * XPay Add reused passwords
  * XPay Add weak passwords
- You CANNOT write test cases
- You CANNOT run any other test cases
- Your responses must be based on these specific capabilities
```

3. Impact Analysis:

a) Response Rules Impact:
- Current rules focus on Current Message
- Adding specific test cases strengthens the "Base response on system capabilities" rule
- Helps prevent referencing unavailable test cases

b) Response Format Impact:
- "If asked to RUN tests" section needs update to reference specific available tests
- Helps prevent accepting tasks for unavailable test cases
- Maintains focus on Current Message while being specific about capabilities

c) TestCaseSet Categories Impact:
- Current categories in prompt.txt may need updating
- Need to align with specific available test cases
- Consider adding new category for "unavailable_test"

4. Benefits of Update:
- Clearer system boundaries
- More specific error responses
- Prevents confusion about available capabilities
- Reduces risk of accepting unavailable test requests
- Maintains focus on Current Message while being precise about capabilities

5. Response Template Updates Needed:
- For unavailable tests:
  "I apologize, but I cannot perform this task at the moment. I can only run specific automated test cases like XPay Create password, XPay Add reused passwords, and XPay Add weak passwords."
  
- For available tests:
  "I will begin working on [specific test name] and will report back with the results."

6. Implementation Recommendations:
a) Update System Capabilities section first
b) Modify Response Format section to match new capabilities
c) Update TestCaseSet categories if needed
d) Add specific response templates
e) Maintain Current Message focus throughout

7. Verification Points:
- Response correctly identifies available vs unavailable tests
- Maintains focus on Current Message
- Provides clear capability limitations
- Offers specific alternatives when appropriate
- Keeps responses professional and concise

Next Steps:
1. Implement capability section updates
2. Update response format section
3. Modify test case categories
4. Add specific response templates
5. Verify changes maintain Current Message focus

Current Prompt Analysis

1. Problematic Areas:
a) Conflicting Instructions
   - "consider the continuity of the conversation" encourages Chat History focus
   - "Output should be based on the Current Message" gets overshadowed
   - No clear prioritization between these competing directives

b) Context Issues
   - "you could not execute the task for now" creates bias towards previous task context
   - "assigned you tasks in your chat before" encourages looking at Chat History
   - System prompt includes both ability to run tests but inability to write them

2. Response Analysis for Example:
Input: "write a test case for Msn.com"
Incorrect Output: "I'm unable to execute the XPay Export and import password test at the moment..."

The response shows three key issues:
a) References XPay test from Chat History instead of addressing Msn.com request
b) Carries over "unable to execute" context from previous state
c) Ignores the actual current request about writing a test case

3. Root Causes:
a) Prompt Structure
   - Context section emphasizes previous tasks and chat history
   - Response guidelines don't clearly prioritize Current Message
   - System capabilities (can run but can't write tests) aren't clearly separated

b) Message Processing
   - No clear instruction to reset context for each new message
   - Missing explicit instruction to ignore previous task states
   - Lack of clear hierarchy in instruction priorities

4. Impact on Model Behavior:
- Model maintains conversation continuity at the expense of current message relevance
- Previous task context bleeds into new, unrelated requests
- Response focuses on inability to execute previous task instead of addressing new request

5. Required Changes:
a) Instruction Clarity
   - Remove or modify conversation continuity directive
   - Add explicit instruction to ignore previous tasks
   - Clearly prioritize Current Message processing

b) Context Management
   - Separate system capabilities from task context
   - Remove "could not execute task" from global context
   - Add instruction to reset context for each new message

c) Response Structure
   - Add explicit instruction to address Current Message content first
   - Remove references to Chat History unless explicitly required
   - Clear separation between system capabilities and task responses
